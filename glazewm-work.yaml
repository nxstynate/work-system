# INTEGRATION NOTES:
#
# 1. Merge these sections into your existing glazewm/config.yaml
# 2. The window_rules use process names - verify these match your system:
#    - Run `glazewm query windows` to see actual process names
# 3. Keybindings may conflict with existing bindings - adjust as needed
# 4. Workspace display_names show in the bar if you have one configured
#
# WORKFLOW:
#   Alt+1 or Alt+N  → Jump to notes
#   Alt+2 or Alt+T  → Jump to Teams
#   Alt+3 or Alt+E  → Jump to Email
#   Alt+4 or Alt+B  → Jump to Browser
#   Alt+7 or Alt+R  → Jump to Render
#
#   Alt+Shift+N     → Move current window to Notes workspace
